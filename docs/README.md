# Simple Universal Turing Machine in Scala

A simple yet flexible Universal Turing Machine simulator in pure Scala.

This program is entirely in a functional style - everything is a `val` and uses the immutable collections.

I guess this will require Scala 2.10.0 or higher to build, I use Scala 2.11.8.

The releases have the Scala runtime bundled into them,
so they can be run with a supported JDK (JDK 1.7+) only,
no Scala runtime is required.

This probably made recursion and higher-order functions my favourite new programming constructs &#x1f609;

Please do report bugs you find, and any feature-requests or critical advice you may have as well.
