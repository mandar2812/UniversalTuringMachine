# Simple Universal Turing Machine in Scala

A simple yet flexible Universal Turing Machine simulator in pure Scala.

I try to adhere to functional programming notions as far as possible, but there is the occasional use of `var` as, well,
Turing Machines are built on the notion of mutable state, and I'm not enough of an expert to convert the simple stuff to (at least to me)
complicated stuff.

Please do report bugs you find, and any feature-requests or critical advice you may have as well.
